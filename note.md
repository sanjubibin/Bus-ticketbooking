## TokenAuthentication
The default expire time for `rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication` is **None**, which means that the token will never expire. However, you can set the expire time by overriding the `expire_delta` property of the `TokenAuthentication` class. For example, the following code will set the expire time to 24 hours:

    ```python
    from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication

    class ExpiringTokenAuthentication(TokenAuthentication):
        expire_delta = timedelta(hours=24)

    ```

Once you have set the expire time, the token will expire after the specified amount of time. If a user tries to authenticate with an expired token, they will receive an authentication error.

Here is an example of how you can set the expire time in a Django project:

    ```python
    from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication

    class ExpiringTokenAuthentication(TokenAuthentication):
        expire_delta = timedelta(hours=24)


    AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES = [
        ExpiringTokenAuthentication,
    ]
    ```

This code will set the expire time for all tokens that are generated by the `ExpiringTokenAuthentication` class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
